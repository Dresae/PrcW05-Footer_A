# Code analysis

## HTML File

### Summary:
This creates a basic footer sctructure comprised of 4 sections each. listing several options for the user to navigate through the website

### Code:
We start defining a 


## CSS File

### Code:

- **@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins:wght@300;400;500;600&display=swap');** 
>> This line imports the Poppins font from Google Fonts. The **@import** rule is used to include external stylesheets. In this case, the stylesheet is hosted on Google Fonts and the font being imported is Poppins with different weights (300, 400, 500, 600). The **url() function** is used to specify the location of the external stylesheet.


- **box-sizing: border-box;**
 >> This sets the box model used by the browser to calculate the width and height of elements.

- **button{**
>> This rule sets the default styles for all button elements on the page. It sets the border to 0, padding to 0, font family to inherit (the same as the parent element), background to transparent, color to inherit (the same as the parent element), cursor to pointer (indicating that the element is clickable), and sets the font size to 20 pixels
 

- **.navbar{**
>> Defines the styling for a navigation bar (.navbar).

>> Here are the key properties being set:

>> **position:** fixed; means the navigation bar will stay in the same position even when the user scrolls. **z-index:** 1; sets the stacking order of the element. **top:** 0; and left: 0; position the navigation bar at the top left corner of the viewport. **display:** flex; makes the navigation bar a flex container. **align-items: center; and justify-content:** center; center the content of the navigation bar both vertically and horizontally. **width: 100%; and height: 80px;** set the width and height of the navigation bar. **background: #101044;** sets the background color of the navigation bar to a dark blue. **color: #ffffff;** sets the text color of the navigation bar to white **font-family: 'Poppins';** sets the font family of the navigation bar to 'Poppins'.

- **.navbar-overlay{**
>> This CSS code snippet defines the styling for an element with the class name "navbar-overlay". It sets the position to fixed, which means the element will stay in the same position even when the page is scrolled. The z-index is set to 2, which determines the stacking order of elements on the page. The top and left properties are set to 0, which positions the element at the top left corner of the viewport. The width and height are set to 100%, making the element cover the entire viewport. The background color is set to a semi-transparent black using the rgba() function. The visibility and opacity properties are initially set to hidden and 0, respectively, which means the element is not visible. Finally, the transition property is set to 0.5s, which specifies that any changes to the visibility and opacity properties will transition over a duration of 0.5 seconds.

- **body.open .navbar-overlay{**
>> This CSS code snippet sets the visibility and opacity properties for the element with the class "navbar-overlay" when the body has a class of "open". This would typically make the navbar-overlay visible and fully opaque when the body is in the "open" state.

- **.navbar-burger{**
>> This CSS code snippet defines a class named .navbar-burger. It sets the position of the element to be absolutely positioned at the top left corner of its containing element. It uses a grid layout to center its content. The element has a width and height of 64 pixels, and its padding is set to 0.

- **.navbar-menu{**
>> This is a CSS code snippet that defines the style for a navigation menu. The menu will be positioned at the top left corner of the screen, with a width of 270 pixels and a height of 100% of its parent element's height. It will have a padding of 30 pixels, and the content will be displayed in a column with a gap of 10 pixels between each item. The background color will be black, and the menu will be initially hidden. There will be a transition effect of 0.5 seconds for all properties.

- **.navbar-menu > button{**
>> This CSS snippet styles the buttons inside the .navbar-menu class. It sets the text color to semi-transparent white, background to transparent, padding around the button text, a transition effect for all properties over 0.3 seconds, and a font size of 17 pixels.

- **@media only screen and (min-width: 600px){**
>> This CSS code snippet is using a media query to apply specific styles when the screen width is at least 600 pixels.
